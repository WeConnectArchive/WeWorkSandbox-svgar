Syntactic sugar for reactive and data-infused svg drawings. No more Rhino screenshots!

Design automation tools are constrained by the interfaces imposed by the program they're written for. Grasshopper and Revit provide verbose geometric and spatial utilities, but consideration for graphical output or user experience often requires [some pretty extreme measures](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/human-ui). What if we could use the drawing *as* the interface? This is svg for architects (that want to turn machines into architects). It's still just svg, but now it's a little sweeter.

Svgar offers:

* High fidelity visuals without an imposed graphic opinion. If svg can do it, svgar can do it.
* A new paradigm of cooking-based package names because all the good animals and bugs are taken.

(Under active development. Targeting an August `0.2.0` public release.)
